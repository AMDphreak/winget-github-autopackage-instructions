# Winget GitHub Integration / Auto-Package Pipeline Setup Instructions

To set up a Winget automation pipeline in GitHub, you need to create a GitHub Actions workflow that utilizes the "wingetcreate" tool to generate Winget manifests, then automatically pushes them to your desired repository, leveraging GitHub secrets to securely store sensitive information like API tokens for private repositories. [1, 2, 3]  
Key steps: [1, 3, 4]  

• Install WingetCreate: [1, 3, 4]  
	• In your GitHub Actions workflow, add a step to install the "wingetcreate" tool using the appropriate package manager for your chosen operating system. [1, 3, 4]  

• Create a Manifest File: [3, 4]  
	• Within your repository, create a .appxmanifest file (or a similar format depending on the application) containing the necessary information for your Winget package (name, publisher, version, etc.). [3, 4]  

• Generate Winget Manifest: [1, 2, 4]  
	• Use a GitHub Actions step with the "wingetcreate" command to generate the Winget manifest file from your .appxmanifest file, specifying any required options like the target repository URL. [1, 2, 4]  

• Authentication for Private Repositories: [2, 4]  
	• Create a GitHub secret to store your personal access token (PAT) needed to push to a private repository. [2, 4]  

• Push to Repository: [2, 3, 4]  
	• Add a step in your workflow to push the generated Winget manifest to your desired repository using the stored PAT. [2, 3, 4]  

Example GitHub Actions Workflow: 
name: Winget Package Automation

on:

  push: 

    branches: [ main ]

jobs:

  build:

    runs-on: windows-latest

    steps:

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install WingetCreate

        run: | 

          # Install WingetCreate using your preferred method (e.g., Chocolatey, Scoop) [4, 10, 11]

      - name: Generate Winget Manifest

        run: | 

          wingetcreate --appxmanifest "path/to/your/appxmanifest.xml" --output "your_package_manifest.yaml" --repo "your-private-repo-url" --token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  [3, 4, 11]

      - name: Push to Repository

        run: | 

          git config user.name "GitHub Actions Bot"

          git config user.email "41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"

          git add your_package_manifest.yaml

          git commit -m "Update Winget Manifest"

          git push origin main [3, 7, 11] 

Important Considerations: [2, 4]  

• Access Level: Ensure your GitHub Actions runner has the required permissions to access your private repositories and execute the necessary commands. [2, 4]  
• Versioning: Implement a strategy to manage package versions within your manifest files to maintain consistency across releases. [2, 4, 5]  
• Testing: Set up a testing process to verify that the generated Winget packages install correctly on target systems before pushing to your repository. [1, 2, 4]
